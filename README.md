# hey there, i'm karol 👋

![profile views](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=karol-broda&color=blueviolet)

i build things that actually work (most of the time). passionate about creating simple, reliable tools that solve real problems without the unnecessary complexity.

## 🚀 what i'm building

- [**funnel**](https://github.com/karol-broda/funnel): a pretty fast tunnel service written in go - because sometimes you need to expose localhost to the world
- [**catalyst**](https://github.com/karol-broda/catalyst): a typesafe python sql builder - making database queries less painful, one type at a time (even in python)
- [**zubr**](https://github.com/karol-broda/zubr): a desktop application for managing and working with postgres databases - because somtimes you dont want to put in 15 commmands from muscle memory to inspect a database

## 🛠 my toolbox

**systems & backend**
- c, go, rust
- python + fastapi
- node.js (and recently some bun) + fastify, hono
- postgresql + drizzle

**frontend & mobile**
- javascript/typescript
- react + next.js
- react native/expo but without eas
- tailwind css

**tools**
- docker
- kubernetes (but only when it is really needed, not when a product has only 100 users)
- gh actions

## 🎯 development philosophy

- start simple, stay simple
- solve real problems, not imaginary ones
- boring technology that works > shiny new framework
- if it takes more than 5 minutes to explain, it's probably too complex

## 🎨 when i'm not coding

- probably reading about why someone rewrote their entire stack in rust
- wondering if that new database really is "10x faster"
- actually touching grass (revolutionary concept, i know)

## 🤝 open to

- building stuff that people actually use
- debating whether that abstraction is worth the complexity
- contributing to projects that solve problems i actually have
- 
## 🌱 currently exploring

- the art of building features that users actually want
- why every "revolutionary" framework solves the same 5 problems
- the eternal quest for the perfect development environment
